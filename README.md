# Data-analysis-using-R-programming
Hello, I have performed basic data visualization of a campus recriutment dataset using R programming languuage. The reason for using R programming language here is that it performs various complex statistical computations and calculations much efficiently. Moreover, R is an excellent choice for data visualization as it provides highly customizable graphs and plots for better visual understanding.
# About the dataset
This data set consists of Placement data of students in a XYZ campus. It includes secondary and higher secondary school percentage and specialization. It also includes degree specialization, type and Work experience and salary offers to the placed students.
# Motives
- To analyse all the base features present in the dataset and see how they interact.
- See whether factors such gender, work experience or board centre affects the placement process.
- If percentages really affect the student's chances of getting placed.
- What degree qualifications are preferred by the recruiters
So, we will start with the first step of the process which will be checking out the data.
# EDA
1. Read the dataset into R and checking the dataset to get the general look of the data
2. After reading the data checking the structure of the columns and getting statistical information about the dataset
3. Cleaning and manipulating the data if necessary.
# Data Visualization
1. After data manipulation, we will move onto the fun part of visualizing the data graphically which will help us better our understanding about the factors affecting the placement results.
2. I have made use of ggplot, as it gives much needed room of customizing the data according to one's desire.
3. The graphs implemented here are: box, histogram, boxplot and scatterplot.
# Results
From the data analysis the conclusion I have reached that although percentages play a crucial role in placement, other factors such as gender and work experience and MBA specialization are of equal importance as well.
From a machine learning point of view, this can be useful in both classification as well as regression based problems.
